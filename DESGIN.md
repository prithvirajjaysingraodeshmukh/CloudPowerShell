Project Identity:
Cloud-Aware Static Security Validation of PowerShell Automation

Core Philosophy:
- Static, pre-execution analysis only
- Cloud security first
- Malware detection is a supporting signal, not the core identity

In Scope:
- Static PowerShell analysis
- Cloud execution context evaluation
- Policy-based cloud security validation
- Cloud risk scoring
- DevSecOps allow/review/block decision
- Explainable security reports

Out of Scope:
- Runtime execution
- Sandboxing
- Live monitoring
- Threat hunting
